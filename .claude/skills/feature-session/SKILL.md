$ARGUMENTS
```

The first argument is the feature directory, the second the session id. If either is
missing, or the directory has no `tasks.md` with a "Sessions" table listing that
session, stop and ask.

## Steps

1. Follow `AGENTS.md` and `doc/workflow.md` to the letter (learning mode: didactic
   proposal, no diffs or pasted code in chat, list every file, functional effect + design
   rationale for structural changes, say what is tested; several viable approaches follow
   "Options"; explicit confirmation before writing, and apply only once the user says
   they have no more doubts; after applying, wait for the user's review).
   `doc/workflow.md` → "Spec-kit features" explains this flow, and "Commits" how this
   session's commit is made.
2. Read `<feature dir>/tasks.md`. The "Sessions" tables (the main one and one per
   `Convergence` phase, if any) say which tasks belong to this session and how it closes. Check that every task of earlier sessions is marked `[X]`;
   if not, stop and tell the user which ones are missing.
3. Read `<feature dir>/spec.md` and `plan.md`, and from `research.workflow.md` only the
   decisions cited by this session's tasks (a feature that predates it, such as
   `specs/001-confirm-email/`, has only `research.md`: read that one instead). Read the `doc/*.md` files whose `AGENTS.md` trigger
   matches the work.
4. Implement only this session's tasks, one proposal per task or per closely related group
   (list each task ID covered). Do NOT run `/speckit-implement`.
5. Close as the "Sessions" table says: run each check, report each result, keep Prettier's
   edits to unrelated files and list them, and mark the finished tasks `[X]` in
   `tasks.md`.
6. Stop and wait for the user's review. Apply any changes they ask for and wait again.
   Once they say it's all OK, commit the session with the message format in
   `doc/workflow.md` → "Spec-kit features", with no `Co-Authored-By` or other AI
   attribution line (`doc/workflow.md` → "Commits"), whatever Claude Code's default says.
